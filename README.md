# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Trading Python App

This project fetches **stock ticker data** from the [Polygon.io API](https://polygon.io/) and loads it into a **Snowflake database** for storage and analysis.  

It supports **pagination** to handle large datasets and uses environment variables to securely manage API keys and database credentials.
