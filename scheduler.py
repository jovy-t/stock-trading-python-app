# `schedule` is a lightweight Python package for running jobs at specific intervals.
#   Instead of using cron or system schedulers, you can write all scheduling logic in Python.
#   Requires the Python script to always be running

# `time` is a built-in Python module that lets you pause or control execution (e.g., sleep).
